        <p>What is sancocho?
 
            Let's start with the name: It's sancocho, not "salcocho" [1].
            
            Sancocho is a broth made from meat and tubers that appears in different forms in various Latin American countries, especially the countries bordering the Caribbean Sea. There are various Colombian sancochos, I have tried the Panamanian chicken sancocho. There is Venezuelan sancocho and Puerto Rican sancocho. In some places they have sancocho with other names: Sancochado, Sopón, Olla de Carne, etc.
            
            As a funny note, in Cuba "sancocho" is a derogatory name that describes the food that is given to pigs.
            
            Anyway, there are a lot of sancochos, and each country has its own tastes in this regard.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Seasoning the meat
                Put the beef, pork and goat meats in a large bowl. Add the lemon juice. Season with parsley (or cilantro), oregano, garlic and 1 teaspoon of salt.
                Mix well and marinate for at least half an hour, preferably an hour.</li>
            <li>In a large pot, heat the oil over high heat. Add the beef, pork, and goat (be careful not to splash).
                Cook until brown. Add the rest of the meats (chicken, ribs, sausage, and ham bones) and the corn. Cook, stirring, for a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium and pour in ½ gallon [2.5 liters] of water. Simmer until it comes to a boil.</li>
            <li>Once the water starts to boil, add pumpkin, chopped plantain and tubers (yam, yuca). Grate or scrape the whole plantain with a knife to turn it into pulp, add to the pot.</li>
            <li>Simmer covered until the last added ingredients are cooked through, it should also have thickened a bit. If it gets too dry, add water as needed.
                Season with salt to taste. </li>
            <li>Remove from heat. Serve as suggested above.</li>
